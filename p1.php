		<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>Who am I? I’m Chad. I’m a musician, skier, artist, maker, traveller, enjoyer of hoppy beer. What do I do? I do lots of things. For work, I create interactive textbooks and digital media for Art and Music textbooks. But lots of other times i’m doing other stuff; like making stuff, playing music or drinking good beer. </p>

		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I’m taking this course because I want to make more digital stuff and be able to say I have some semblance of knowledge on the process. Also, I heard PHP is pretty neat. And it counts toward the requirements of the ALM in IT. </p>

		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I took CS 50 and felt like somebody took a whisk to my brain. I’ve also taken other HTML and CSS type classes, but I don’t think those really count as programming. Scratch is pretty cool too. </p>

		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I’m working on a Mac. </p>

		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>The picture above was taken in Valdez Alaska.</p>
